# Global Rules For Codex Work

These rules define the default operating model for `.codex/` across repositories.

## 1. Context Loading

- Prefer `docs/00-general-docs.md` when it exists.
- If that index is missing, use `README.md`, local docs, config files, and the source tree to reconstruct context.
- Treat missing or stale documentation as a risk to record, not as a reason to guess.

## 2. Planning And Logging

- For non-trivial work, create `.orchestrator/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-slug/`.
- Keep `investigation.md`, `design.md`, `plan.md`, and `implementation.md` aligned with the actual work.
- Break implementation into atomic tasks that are independently verifiable.
- Log major decisions where the next session can recover without re-reading the whole codebase.

## 3. Git Safety

- Do not run `git commit`, `git push`, merge, or branch deletion unless the user explicitly requested a delivery step.
- When a delivery step is requested, use Conventional Commits.
- If the workspace is not a Git repository, skip Git-specific instructions and state that clearly.

## 4. Codex-Native Execution

- Prefer local tools that exist in this environment: `rg`, `find`, `sed`, `git diff`, `git status`, `apply_patch`, shell commands, and sub-agents when delegation helps.
- Do not reference external helper runners or hidden automation that is not present in the repository.
- Keep the critical path local. Delegate only bounded side work with clear ownership.

## 5. Engineering Standards

- Use an error budget of three attempts when fixing the same failing check.
- Keep docs synchronized when the target repository maintains docs as part of the workflow.
- Preserve separation between UI, domain logic, and data access.
- Never hardcode secrets; prefer environment variables and documented setup.
- Favor tests for critical business logic and regressions.

## 6. Knowledge Distillation

- When a non-obvious decision or fix is made, update the most relevant file in `.codex/skills/` or the active plan.
- Do not let important context live only in transient chat history.
